# Gradient-boosting-algorithm
### Project Overview
This project employs a gradient boosting algorithm to predict whether a loan application is approved based on an individualâ€™s age, income, and years of experience. Gradient boosting is a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (decision trees) to form a strong predictive model. It iteratively reduces errors, resulting in high accuracy and generalization.
